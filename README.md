# Constraint Field Theory (CFT)

This project is exploratory but disciplined. Claims are intentionally scoped,
terminology is defined before use, and every proposed mechanism is paired with
a potential route to falsification.

Constraint Field Theory proposes that many “limits” we observe in complex systems (physics, biology, cognition, engineered software)
can be modeled as a field-like structure that:
- propagates constraints,
- saturates at boundaries,
- and produces stable observables.

This repository contains:
- **theory/**: definitions, axioms, minimal formalism, predictions, falsification tests
- **models/**: toy models and simulations
- **src/**: reference implementation scaffolding (Python)
- **tests/**: sanity checks and reproducibility hooks

## Core idea (one sentence)
Reality behaves less like unbounded acceleration and more like motion through a medium: constraints accumulate, couple, and saturate.

## Status
Early-stage working draft. The goal is clarity, falsifiability, and minimal hype.

  **Intuition (informal):**  
Many systems behave less like unbounded acceleration and more like motion through a medium:
constraints accumulate, couple, and saturate.
