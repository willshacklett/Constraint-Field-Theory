# Constraint Field Theory — Working Paper

This directory contains the draft manuscript for Constraint Field Theory (CFT).

The paper is intentionally developed in parallel with code:
- theory/ defines concepts and axioms
- src/ and examples/ generate figures and toy results
- this paper integrates both into a coherent, falsifiable framework

Status: early draft scaffold.
