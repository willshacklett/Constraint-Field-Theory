\begin{abstract}
Constraint Field Theory (CFT) explores whether many observed limits in complex systems
can be modeled as a structured, saturating constraint field.
This paper introduces definitions, axioms, minimal formalism,
testable predictions, and falsification criteria,
supported by toy simulations.

\section{Introduction}

Across many domains, complex systems exhibit persistent limits.
Physical systems display bounded responses to increasing energy input,
biological systems saturate under resource pressure,
cognitive systems encounter attention and processing ceilings,
and engineered software systems degrade or destabilize beyond certain loads.

These limits are often treated as domain-specific artifacts:
material strength limits in physics,
carrying capacities in biology,
or performance bottlenecks in software.
While such explanations are locally effective,
they provide little insight into why saturation, stability,
and boundary behavior appear so consistently across disparate systems.

A recurring pattern is that increasing input does not lead to proportional output.
Instead, systems enter regimes of diminishing returns,
plateaus, or abrupt transitions.
Understanding the structure of these regimes is critical for prediction,
control, and long-horizon reliability.

This paper explores whether these recurring behaviors can be modeled
using a common abstraction:
a constraint field that encodes how limits arise,
propagate, and saturate within a system.
