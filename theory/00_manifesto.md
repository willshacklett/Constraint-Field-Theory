# Constraint Field Theory — Manifesto

Constraint Field Theory (CFT) begins from a simple observation:

Many systems do not behave like unconstrained trajectories through state space.
Instead, they exhibit saturation, stability, and boundary behavior that emerges
independently of the specific components involved.

CFT proposes that these behaviors can be modeled as a *constraint field*:
a distributed structure that encodes how limits arise, propagate, and couple
across a system.

This theory does **not** posit a new force, agent, or metaphysical entity.
It is a modeling layer intended to:
- reduce explanatory complexity,
- unify disparate “limit” phenomena under a common structure,
- and generate testable, falsifiable predictions.

If CFT is useful, it should:
1. compress explanations across domains,
2. predict saturation and coupling signatures before they are observed,
3. fail clearly where constraint-based modeling is inappropriate.

The remainder of this repository develops definitions, axioms,
minimal formalism, predictions, and falsification routes.
