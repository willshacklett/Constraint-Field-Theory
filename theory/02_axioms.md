# Axioms of Constraint Field Theory

These axioms are intentionally minimal.  
If CFT is useful, most consequences should follow from them without embellishment.

---

## Axiom 1 — Existence of Constraints
Not all theoretically imaginable states of a system are physically or operationally reachable.

Constraints are real features of systems, not artifacts of incomplete knowledge.

---

## Axiom 2 — Structure of Constraints
Constraints are structured rather than random.

They exhibit continuity, locality (or weak non-locality), and repeatable patterns across
space, time, or abstract state space.

---

## Axiom 3 — Propagation
Constraints can propagate.

A change in constraint intensity or configuration in one region of a system
can influence reachable states in other regions.

---

## Axiom 4 — Saturation
Constraints saturate.

Beyond a threshold, increasing input, force, energy, or effort produces diminishing
or null changes in system behavior.

---

## Axiom 5 — Observable Projection
The state of a constraint field admits at least one stable observable projection.

This observable summarizes constraint behavior in a way that is measurable,
trackable, and comparable across time or systems.
