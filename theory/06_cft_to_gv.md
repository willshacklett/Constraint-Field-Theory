# From Constraint Field Theory to Gv

This note describes how the God Variable (Gv) relates to Constraint Field Theory (CFT)
without redefining or absorbing the theory itself.

## Conceptual Relationship

In CFT, a constraint field C encodes how limits and boundaries shape the space of
reachable states in a system.

CFT does not prescribe a single observable.
Instead, it asserts that stable observable projections exist.

Gv is one such projection.

## Gv as an Observable Projection

Within the CFT formalism, an observable G is defined as:
G = Π(C)

where Π is a projection that preserves ordering and stability.

Gv instantiates this role by:
- aggregating multiple constraint dimensions,
- applying saturation,
- producing a bounded scalar suitable for comparison and gating.

Gv is therefore not the constraint field itself,
but a measurable summary of its state.

## Operationalization

CFT is descriptive and structural.
Gv is operational.

CFT explains why bounded observables should exist.
Gv provides a concrete implementation that can be computed,
tracked over time, and used in decision systems.

## Non-Equivalence

CFT ≠ Gv.

CFT can exist without Gv.
Gv derives meaning from CFT.

This separation preserves the generality of the theory
while allowing practical applications.
