# Falsification Routes

Constraint Field Theory must fail clearly if it is not useful.

The following observations would count against CFT as a modeling framework.

---

## Falsification 1 — Absence of Saturation

If a system under sustained increasing drive continues to exhibit unbounded,
linear, or superlinear response without saturation or boundary effects,
CFT provides no advantage.

---

## Falsification 2 — No Coupling Effects

If modifying one constraint dimension produces no correlated changes
in others when CFT predicts coupling, the framework is insufficient.

---

## Falsification 3 — No Stable Observables

If no scalar or low-dimensional projection of system behavior remains stable
across time, environments, or perturbations, CFT loses explanatory power.

---

## Falsification 4 — Predictive Failure

If CFT cannot predict novel behavior beyond post hoc curve fitting,
it should be abandoned in favor of simpler models.
