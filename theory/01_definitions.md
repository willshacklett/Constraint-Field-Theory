# Definitions

## Constraint
A constraint is any rule or boundary that restricts the set of reachable states
of a system.

## Constraint Field
A constraint field is a structured distribution of constraints over space,
time, or abstract state space that determines how limits vary and interact.

Notation placeholders:
- C(x, t): constraint field over spacetime
- C(s): constraint field over state space

## Saturation
Saturation occurs when increasing input or drive produces diminishing or null
changes in system behavior due to constraint limits.

## Coupling
Coupling refers to dependencies between constraints, such that modifying one
constraint alters others.

## Observable
An observable is a measurable scalar or vector derived from the constraint field
that summarizes system behavior in a stable way.
