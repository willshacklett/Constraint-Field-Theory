# Predictions of Constraint Field Theory

This section outlines observable signatures that should appear
if Constraint Field Theory provides a useful description of a system.

These are not retroactive explanations; they are forward-facing expectations.

## Prediction 1 — Saturation Curves

Systems operating under increasing drive (energy, effort, load, optimization pressure)
will exhibit saturation behavior.

Observable response will deviate from linear growth and approach a bounded regime.

This should occur even when no explicit hard limit is designed into the system.

---

## Prediction 2 — Constraint Coupling Signatures

Perturbations to one constraint dimension will produce correlated changes
in other constraint dimensions.

These correlations may appear as:
- delayed responses,
- nonlinear amplification,
- or suppression effects.

Independent-constraint models should fail to capture these signatures.

## Prediction 3 — Boundary Stability

Near constraint boundaries, systems will exhibit stable behavioral regimes.

Small perturbations will not cause qualitative state transitions
unless constraint thresholds are crossed.

This produces plateaus, hysteresis, or phase-like behavior.

---

## Prediction 4 — Observable Compression

A small number of scalar observables derived from the constraint field
will summarize system behavior more robustly than many independent metrics.

These observables should remain stable across environmental variation
where component-level measurements fluctuate.

## Prediction 5 — Cross-Domain Transfer

Constraint signatures (saturation, coupling, boundary behavior)
should appear in structurally different domains
(e.g., physics, biology, cognition, software systems)
despite differing substrates.
